# Objective

* Spotify Data Analysis makes use of secondary data from Spotify. Learners will use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics. 
* The activity will support learners in developing their ability to review and interpret a dataset. 
* The activity starts by encouraging learners to think of questions that the dataset might answer and thus develop their “Problem” skills. Once the dataset has been analysed learners will have the opportunity to reorganise and restructure data to help them answer their questions
